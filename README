Our Proof of Concept (POC) provides a new and innovative solution as to the CDC's conundrum of tracking and alerting individuals that have been in contact with a positive testing COVID patient. This POC identifies two different parties that will use the application: Students/Faculty and University Officials. The Students/Faculty will be using the application in a "background" aspect in-which the main use of the application is to share location data with the University. This information sharing is to allow University officials to quickly determine if the individual has been in contact with a positive COVID patient. Students/Faculty will still have the ability to notify the University, through the application, that they have tested positive for COVID, at which point, individual can also provide feedback as to where they were located for more than 15 minutes. This is specifically for public areas (cafeteria, library, etc.) so that University Officials can share a mass notification, letting all students know if they should be social distancing due to being in said public areas at the same time. Each student that receives notice of a connection to a positive COVID result will also receive CDC guidance and nearby testing locations.
The University Officials have an administrator aspect that allows them to send notifications to select or all students to inform them of CDC social distancing guidelines in the case that the individual came into contact with a positive COVID patient. They will also have access to a full list of student IDs that have been confirmed cases of COVID allowing them to reach out to the student and reach out to classmates that might have been exposed. Using the University class information, the administrator can notify all individuals in the student's classes that they need to social distance and be aware of CDC guidelines. After 2 days, the administrator can reach back out to these students and ask if there have been any COVID symptoms and check if new individuals have tested positive as well. The POC is designed to be a background application until it is needed to send mass information and to assist in preventing the spread of COVID. Administrators are given access to pertinent data that can be used to prevent a spread of COVID while following CDC and HIPAA guidelines.
